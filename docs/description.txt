* constructor: call once, can fetch prop and init state maybe there
* render: when render calls, it calls all childs render after render all ui section inside render method, then did mount of current component will calls
* componentDidMount: after render, good location to fetch from api and set state
** now:
app ctor
app render
nav ctor
nav render
product ctor
product render
product ctor
product render
product ctor
product render
nav did mount
product did mount (3)
app did mount

* after state changes these 2 methods will run: first render, then componentDidUpdate.
* componentDidUpdate: when update occurred (state changes)
* componentWillUnMount: when a component will remove, maybe in a list, we delete an item, that item's component will unmount
